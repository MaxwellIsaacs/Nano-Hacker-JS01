<h1>This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Yeah, sure, okay. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? (confused) Where? (in a what's-wrong-with-you voice) Back to the future! (with conviction) Right. Let's get going. (he sets down his glass) Great. Gentlemen, excuse me, but my friend and I have to catch a train. Well, thanks. Nice talking to you. Maybe we'll bump into each other some time again in the future. Or in the past. (1985 Doc gets on his bike and ride off, ringing his bell. 1955 Doc looks up. That ring sounded very familiar!) (High School) (Biff gets out of his car. Marty watches him walk off, and tries to grab the almanac. Biff suddenly remembers it, and comes back for it. Marty hides away just in time. Biff re-enters the building, and Marty follows him in. He watches Biff enter the hall where the dance is being held, but Marty stays outside.) Where's Einstein, is he with you? Yeah, he's right here. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. (Biff kisses Lorraine. Marty can't believe it.) No!!! (He steps backwards - into the arms of 3-D, Match and Skinhead. Skinhead grabs Marty.) No! Hey wait, you're coming with us upstairs! Let me go! Sonny, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.</h1>
